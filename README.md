## Usage

Coding can seem overwhelming so I built this study guide to help understand a few key points to different topics. I myself was able to use this study guide to learn ideals and terms that will later on help myself become a professional coder. Topics such as 'HTML', 'CSS', 'GIT', & 'JavaScript' are covered in this guide.
